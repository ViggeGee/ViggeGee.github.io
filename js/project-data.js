            <p>
                Chained 2 Violence is my so far biggest game. 
                I made it together with a team of 7 for our final University Project.
                It's a 2 player co-op arena game similar to games like Vampire Survivor 
                but with the twist of you being chained together with your friend!
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <h3>My Part</h3>
            <p>
                My primary responsibility was to implement the Procedurally generated content of the game.
                I made every enemy be generated visually unique with different constraints based on the enemy type and what the current "era" of the game it is.
                This resulted in around a million uniquely looking enemies. 
                The most difficult part about this was to allow the enemies to always look different but still feel cohesive to the game and easy to understand what enemy type it belonged to
            </p>
            <p>
                I also created all the arenas for the game as well as the majority of the visual effects, shaders, etc.
            </p>
